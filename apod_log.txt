Final Project Log - Silas Gilders 


March 17th: Introduced to Final Project, did an initial run of the script to see what I have, added URL to image
March 17th: Added very beginning of Hashing, need to make it print the hash of the image, not the URL itself
March 18th: No strike! Still struggling away at this, unsure of the way I did hashing, and may have to check if the URl is correct
cont: Script runs at least, output is not correct yet.
March 26th: Took a long break, changed which Variable I get the hash from, to make it make more sense to me, posted question on-
cont: Discussion forums, still waiting for an answer
March 28th: Jeremy responded, working on what he advised to start with, ran into a roadblock and confusion, emailed Jeremy.
March 29th: Had a minor breakdown :)
April 11th: Made changes to how the Image URL variable works with the help of Jeremy, now works correctly.
